	 * 			~ it is implemented with service locator pattern usually

	/**
	*	It is a design pattern --> it is for obtaining the processes involved in 
	*		obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer
	*
	*			We have a central registry  "service locator"
	*
	*		ADVANTAGES
	*			- it is like a run-time linker: allows code to be added at run-time without re-compiling
	*				the source code
	*			- can make some optimization
					For example: the application can detect it has a better database library
	*					than the default one -> alter the registry accordingly
	*
	*		DISADVANTAGES
	*
	*			- black box: harder to detect and recover form errors
	*			- registry hides the dependencies --> causes run-time errors instead of
	*				compile-time ones and we do not like it
				- difficult to maintain the registry: dependency injection is more convenient
				
				
			SERVICE LOCATOR VS DEPENDENCY INJECTION 
				Both are the just implementations of the dependency inversion principle !!!
						~ so depend upon abstraction rather than on implementation --> loosely couple
				
				- with service locator the application class asks for it explicitly
						by a message to the locator
				- With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears
					in the application class ï¿½ hence the inversion of control
				- easier to test applications with dependency injection
				- THE CHOICE IS NOT SO IMPORTANT: THE PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT -> WE SHOULD SEPARATE
					SERVICE CONFIGURATION FROM THE USE OF SERVICES WITHIN AN APPLICATION
